## Introduction
Nativefier is a command-line tool that effortlessly creates desktop apps for websites, wrapped by Electron in an OS executable (.app, .exe, etc) for use on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

In this project, I've developed a desktop application for [https://dev.java/](https://dev.java/)â€”the go-to platform for Java developers, offering hundreds of tutorials, news, and videos from experts.

## How to use
### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure that Nativefier is installed on your system. For more information, check out their [repository](https://github.com/nativefier/nativefier).

### Build the Desktop App
Install Nativefier and run 
```bash
nativefier "https://dev.java/"
```

***Run the Desktop App***

Once the build process is complete, you'll find the executable file for your operating system (e.g., .app for macOS, .exe for Windows) in the output directory. Run the executable to launch the Dev.Java desktop app.
