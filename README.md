## Introduction
Nativefier is a command-line tool to easily create a desktop app for any web site with minimal fuss. Apps are wrapped by Electron in an OS executable (.app, .exe, etc) usable on Windows, macOS and Linux.

Here, I have created a desktop application to use https://dev.java/ (The destination for Java developers. Hundreds of tutorials, news and videos from the experts, all right here).

## How to use
### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have (Nativefier)[https://github.com/nativefier/nativefier] installed on your system. Checkout their repoitory for more information.
```bash

```
Certainly! Here's the README with a table of contents in Markdown:

## Introduction

Nativefier for Dev.Java is a command-line tool that enables you to convert the Dev.Java website into a standalone desktop application. This allows Java developers to access tutorials, news, and videos conveniently from their desktop.

## How to Use

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have [Nativefier](https://github.com/nativefier/nativefier) installed on your system.

### Build the Desktop App
Install Nativefier and run 
```bash
nativefier "https://dev.java/"
```

***Run the Desktop App***
Once the build process is complete, you'll find the executable file for your operating system (e.g., .app for macOS, .exe for Windows) in the output directory. Run the executable to launch the Dev.Java desktop app.
